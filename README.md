# 👋 Hi, I’m @semwaqas

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate Full Stack Developer specialized in the MERN stack, React Native, Solidity, and RUST for Blockchain technologies. With a keen interest in building scalable, efficient, and robust applications, I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to grow.

## 👀 I’m interested in Blockchain Technology

My fascination with blockchain technology drives me to explore its limitless potential. From decentralized applications (DApps) to smart contracts, I am constantly experimenting with how to leverage blockchain to solve real-world problems.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning Advanced Solidity Patterns

As part of my journey to deepen my expertise in blockchain, I'm diving into advanced Solidity patterns and exploring the latest developments in Ethereum 2.0. I'm also keen on understanding the subtleties of cross-chain technologies to build more integrated and efficient blockchain solutions.

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Open Source Projects

I'm eager to collaborate with other enthusiasts on open source projects, especially those focused on blockchain, web3, and decentralized finance (DeFi). If you're working on something exciting and could use an extra pair of hands (or codes!), feel free to reach out.

## ⚡ Fun fact: I'm Table Tennis Player

When I'm not coding or deploying smart contracts, you'll likely find me perfecting my table tennis skills. I believe the precision, reflexes, and strategy required in table tennis mirror the qualities needed in programming and problem-solving. Each shot teaches focus, adaptability, and quick decision-making—essential skills in both the game and life.
